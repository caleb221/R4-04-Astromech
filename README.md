# IN PROGRESS! CHECK BACK FOR UPDATES!
   --> finishing up the .ino control code, but hardware is finished!
   
# Description  
 <h2>This is R4-04!</h2> <br>Designed with the <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/R4_astromech_droid">R4 Astromech droid</a> in mind, but getting lost along the way resulted in R4-04, the droid for a galaxy not so far away.<br>
 This droid hosts its own WiFi network, and anyone in reach can accesss a web server holding a livestream of the IP camera and controls for the droid.<br>
 The IP of the droid's control server is printed on the bright blue LCD screen.<br>
 The droid is controlled using websocket communication on the ESP32 and relays information from the user to an Arduino Mega  controlling the motors via I2C commands. The Arduino also handles a self balancing routine, adjusting its shoulders with PID so that rougher terrain won't be a problem.<br> 
Along with the motor control, R4-04 also shows information concerning its environment on a second screen. The information is obtained via a BME280 Sensor.

  # Schematic
<img src="https://github.com/caleb221/R4-04-Astromech/blob/main/droidImg/Schematic_R4-04 Astromech_2021-06-02.png" alt="A simple schematic" width=700 height=500>


# 3D Printer Settings
Printer: Creality Ender 3 pro V2<br>
Filament: Duramic PETG<br> 
Infill: 20% <br>
Support: 2% everywhere<br>
Temp: 235<br>
Slicer: Cura
--> Slow on the first layer<br>
--> PLA Should be just fine for the parts as well, i just had PETG because it was cheaper at the time.<br>

# STL / FREECAD FILES
I designed the droid using FreeCAD, which is free and works on all major OS platforms.<br>
You are free to edit / change all designs, but please give a reference to the original!<br>
Printing all parts goes like this:<br>
1 of each in the UPPER folder (upper head / neck)<br>
2 legs, 2 Shoulders, 2 droidFourthBody sections, and 1 of each on the rest in the MIDDLE folder. (middle body)<br>
2 legs, 2 feet, 1 of each 3rd foot component in the LOWER folder. (lower body)<br>

# Mechanical Notes
The TT motor and wheel attatch to the foot using  M3 X 35MM screw and nuts. The leg is attached using 2 bearings and a 5/16'' bolt and nut.
There is a hole for the wires in the middle of the foot, as well as a space for them to fit on the side of the leg.

The backside view of the droid.
There is a door that utilizes an M3 X 20 screw to hold both pieces in place.
Springs are attached from the stepper motor's M4 screw to the Foot's 5/16'' bolt. These are optional but help the droid remain standing under its own weight. The M4 screws I used hindered the neck from reaching the gear, this will be fixed in V2.

<br>
There is a stepper motor with the smaller neck control gear attached to the top of the body using M4 screw and nuts. <br>
The neck assembly is glued into place on the head and is not glued to the body. SDA,SCL, 5V, and GND are run through the neck to reach the ESP32-CAM.<br>

<br>
The Front foot uses 4 bearings and an M3 x 8mm nut and screw that fits in the middle. Along with 2 5/16'' bolts to hold the wheel and leg in place. The springs are attached on the outside of each bolt which help restrict the freedom of movement.

# Disclaimer:
 This R4 Unit is a personal voyage in learning freeCAD and helped me form a new curriculum for a Robotics Class.<br>
 It is not in any way meant to represent work of Disney, Star Wars, or any legal stuff. I don't know how to put this correctly, but its not a 501st worthy model. But still fun to build!
